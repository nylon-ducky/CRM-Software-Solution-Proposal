# CRM-Software-Solution-Proposal
Class: C188 Software Engineering

This class required a business proposal for a CRM Solution as one of the projects.


#Introduction
American Video Game Company is accepting proposals to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. This document is a business vision document that includes key business requirements for the new system. It does not provide detailed system requirements.

This document provides enough information for a vendor to provide a recommendation for a system to fit the American Video Game Company’s needs. The proposal provided by the vendor is required to be comprehensive and include enough detail so American Video Game Company can determine if it fits the needs of the organization. The project that will be undertaken with the vendor who is awarded the contract will then include steps to produce the detailed requirements, use cases, design, and other deliverables. 

Open source, off the shelf, configurable/customizable off the shelf, commercial offerings, and custom development are all acceptable solutions to fit the requirements. There may be an existing system that will fulfill all the needs of the organization, but if custom development is more appropriate, this may be proposed, with supporting information. The vendor is to keep in mind the changes and enhancements that may be required throughout the life of the system as well as the scalability of the system when completing the proposal. 

#Background
American Video Game Company is planning to launch an internal CRM system to allow for better management of several disconnected manual and automated processes. The system should be able to be integrated with other systems now and in the future to maximize and improve the efficiency of data sharing, reporting, and business process flows.

The company is a premier developer and publisher of computer games. The games are well designed and highly enjoyable for the customer. The company is known for the quality of its games and has been ranked #1 for several years. The games are purchased through different mediums, including an online game service. There are mobile options for some, but not all, of the games the company develops and sells. The company also offers products such as action figures, novels, comics, board games, and apparel. Future endeavors may include working on producing movies based on the characters and plots in the games.

Sales have been up by 42% in the past two years, so the company is currently outgrowing its existing systems for managing all aspects of CRM. The new system will be a crucial tool in being able to efficiently manage client contacts, perform sales tracking, maintain activity management, and manage reporting.
